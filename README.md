## Title: Tableau-Project-Health-Survey-Project

### Aim: Analysis to assist the NHS in making decisions.

Using the Health data set, conduct an analysis to find trends and key information that could be used by an organization for future support.  There is no set scope for the analysis, simply to find trends and document them. Data can be lifesaving and is being used more within the NHS, reflect on how this data could support decision making for the NHS. 
As a result, this analysis was limited to the United Kingdom. 

The data set was alread in Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) file, though there was a Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xlsx) file attached to it. To maximize time I open the Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) file. however, I review and ensure that the assigned data types by Tableau is correct. Below are the two files if you wish to access them.


**Also I used the **Calculated Fields** to calculate and create Total Cancer Rate using this [Liver Cancer] + [Lung Cancer] + [Stomach Cancer] as seen in the Data Pane below**. 

Attached  is the Dataset and the Data Pane. 

**Dataset:**

As there is no set scope for the analysis, simply to find trends. I made a number of charts inorder to become more familiar with the Tableau environment. 

Here are some of them:

**Global Health Indicator-1990**

**Cancer Analysis**

**Gender Health Overview**

**Life Expectancy by Country.**

**BMI and Life expectancy over the years**

Below is the dashboard for this project. This dashboard comprises of the following charts: **Global Health Indicators-1990, Average Life Expectance and Average BMI in all the years, Cancer Analysis, and Description.**

**Findins and Recommendations**

**Cancer Analysis:** This will help NHS to allocate resources efficiently based on cancer prevalence.  
Stomach cancer decreasing might be as a result of better food hygiene, proper use of antibiotics. NHS can continue campaign for food hygiene and proper use of antibiotics.
Liver  cancer increasing can be as a result of  rising alcohol consumption, increase in obesity rates, fatty liver disease, hepatitis B&C. NHS can start a campaign like alcohol reduction programmes, obesity and diet improvement, hepatitis screening. 
Lung cancer being constant shows NHS policies on smoking might have stabilized the cases but have not reduce them over the years. NHS can work more on targeted intervention programmes on smoking.

**Gender Health Overview:** This shows that men have both higher life expectancy and higher cancer rate than women. NHS can focus attention to know why women have less life expectancy and why men have higher cancer rate than women.

**Life Expectancy by Country:** This shows that Japan has the highest life expectancy while United Kingdom is the 20th. NHS can look more on how to increase life expectancy in United Kingdom so that it will fall within the first five countries with highest life expectancy.

**BMI and Life expectancy over the years:**  BMI is directly proportional to life expectancy in the United Kingdom. NHS should create more information on BMI and programmes that will promote people to have good BMI. As this will increase life expectancy.
